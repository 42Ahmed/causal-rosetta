## How Did We Get Here? (Who is Grandpa?)

  * **The Origins (The Lab):** Back in the 19th century, researchers in medicine and agriculture invented statistics to solve problems in their domains.

      * *Key Context:* These domains existed inside **laboratories** and controlled fields. If they wanted to know if a fertilizer worked, they simply controlled the environment.

  * **The Standardization:** Statistics was not set in stone. In the 20th century, a fierce debate occurred between the giants **Neyman, Pearson, and Fisher**. This solidified the rules of the game (hypothesis testing), resulting in the creation of the first official Statistics Departments.

  * **The Ivory Tower:** The graduates of these new departments were experts in math and probability.

      * They began working on abstract theorems and "perfect" distributions.
      * They rarely saw the messy, broken data coming from the real world. This became known as **Mathematical Statistics**.

  * **The Wild:** Later on, economists realized they needed statistics too.

      * *The Problem:* They worked in the wild, not the lab. They could not "control" the economy or people's choices.

  * **The Birth of Econometrics:** Economists used these tools to **estimate** the magnitude of relationships (e.g., supply and demand) and **test** economic theories.

      * *The Flaw:* Estimation wasn't enough. In the real world, thousands of variables move together. You couldn't isolate the true effect of a policy because you couldn't hold everything else constant.

  * **The Distinction:**

      * **Mathematical Statistics:** They invent the math first. They assume a perfect world, derive a theorem, and then check if it fits a lab setting.
      * **Econometrics:** They look at the messy data first. They realize standard testing is impossible, so they invent new techniques to handle the mess.

  * **The Destination (Causal Inference):** Causal Inference is the modern extension of econometrics. It is the specific pursuit of identifying the **exact effect** of a treatment, getting results from the wild as if we are in a lab.

### The Analogy: The Disease

To understand the difference, imagine a new virus appears:

  * **Mathematical Statistics:** Invents a theoretical disease that follows a perfect bell curve. Invents a cure for that theoretical disease. Waits for a patient to actually catch it.
  * **Econometrics:** Inspects the sick patients we have right now. Tries to cure them using available data. realizes the data is biased, so they improve the cure.
  * **Causal Inference:** Doing everything the econometrician does, but with a laser focus on proving that *it was the cure* that saved the patient, not just luck.

## What Will We Learn?

  * **The Anti-Textbook Approach:**

      * Formal books often gatekeep this knowledge behind rigorous Calculus, Linear Algebra, Numerical Analysis, and Probability Theory.
      * By the time you finish the prerequisites, you’ve forgotten why you wanted to learn this in the first place.

  * **The Toolkit:**

      * Here, we will learn the useful stuff **as we go**.
      * Think of this as a backpack containing only what you need for the journey—no heavy, unnecessary theory.

  * **The Blend:**

      * We will blend classical **Econometrics** (the foundation) with modern **Causal Inference** (the design) and **Machine Learning** (the power).
